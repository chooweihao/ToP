\begin{abstract}
The tradeoff premium extends existing ``one-sided'' premium principles and risk measures to address both overpricing and underpricing
concerns. The tradeoff premium is a weighted average loss, where weights increase with ``conditional percentile rank deviations'' from a
reference point. Tradeoff premiums reduce to loss aversion reserves or equivalently distortion risk measures when only underpricing
concerns are present. Tradeoff premiums are also expected losses under a modified probability distribution based on cumulative prospect
theory.

\section{Introduction and overview}

This paper proposes the ``tradeoff premium.'' The tradeoff premium is a weighted average loss from an insurance contract.
 The weights in the average increase as losses move into both the upper and lower tail.
, reflecting aversion to both under and overpricing .
Overpricing causes loss of business in a competitive market and underpricing depletes capital.
The tradeoff premium is  ``two-sided'' and contrasts with  existing ``one sided''  premiums focussing solely
on  ``large'' loss outcomes and underpricing.
The tradeoff premium is shown to comprise of the average loss, a loading to avoid underpricing and a discount to avoid overpricing.  Avoiding
both over and underpricing involves a tradeoff, and relative sizes of the loading and discount determine the overall magnitude of the tradeoff
premium.

The tradeoff premium depends on a ``reference point'' dividing over and underpricing. Changing the reference point shifts the relative
aversion between over and underpricing. For example increasing the reference point decreases the tradeoff premium by raising the relative
aversion to overpricing. A zero reference point implies nil aversion to overpricing, and yields the usual``one-sided'' premiums



Weights in the tradeoff premium are determined by an aversion function on the ``departure" between loss outcomes and the reference point.
The departure is measured using ``conditional percentile rank deviation''. Conditional percentile rank deviations are differences between
percentile ranks of loss outcomes and the reference point,  scaled to fit the unit interval. Using this weight formulation, the tradeoff premium is
the average loss under a density transformed using cumulative prospect theory, where cumulative probabilities of moderate and extreme
outcomes are weighted less and more, respectively. If the reference point is zero, the tradeoff premium reduces to distortion and spectral risk
measures.

Tradeoff premiums are two-sided versions of existing one-sided premiums or risk measures.
For example the ``two-sided Value-at-Risk'' is a weighted average of upper and lower extreme percentiles.
The ``two-sided Conditional-Tail-Expectation'' is also a weighted average, of conditional expected losses in the upper and lower tails. In both
examples, changing the reference point shifts the relative representation of ``large'' and ``small'' losses in the tradeoff premium.

Other properties of the tradeoff premium are explored. The tradeoff premium is ``nearly coherent.''  Only the subadditivity property of
coherence is not satisfied since both the loading and discount in the tradeoff premium reduce when insurance contracts are aggregated, to
reflect lower loss variability from diversification. The overall impact of aggregation hence involves a tradeoff.

Tradeoff premiums are  ``balanced'' when their percentile equals the selected reference point. If this occurs, conditional percentile rank
deviations are linked to actual premium surplus or shortfall. A balanced premium always exists and is unique. In addition it equalises
expected premium shortfall and surplus under a transformed loss density, hence balancing the conflicting objectives of  over and
underpricing.

Remaining sections proceed as follows. Section \aref{definition} defines and justifies the tradeoff premium for a random loss using a specified
reference point and aversion function. Section \aref{prospecttheory} expresses the tradeoff premium as an expected loss under a modified
probability distribution consistent with cumulative prospect theory. Section \aref{negativerelationship} shows the tradeoff premium decreases
with the reference point due to increasing relative aversion to overpricing, and is equivalent to loss aversion reserves and distortion risk
measures for a zero reference point. Section \aref{balancedpremium} defines the balanced premium as a special case when effects of
overpricing and underpricing concerns are equalized. Other links with existing literature are discussed in \sref{otherlinks}. Section
\aref{premiumloading} decomposes the premium loading into a discount and markup, typical of a profit maximizing firm receiving a separate
volume benefit. Theoretical examples of tradeoff premiums are shown in \sref{theoreticaleg}. Section \aref{policyholderperspective} shows
the tradeoff premium is applicable to a policyholder trading off financial consequences of large loss outcomes and the ``wastage'' of
insurance coverage when loss outcomes are favourable. Practical properties of tradeoff premiums are discussed in \sref{properties}. Finally
\sref{numericaleg} calculates tradeoff and balanced premiums assuming a gamma loss distribution and power aversion function.


\section{The tradeoff premium}\label{definition}

Consider a loss $x\geq 0$ having distribution function $F$ and percentile rank $u\equiv F(x)$.  Then $u$ is uniformly distributed on the unit interval and indicates the severity of the loss, with $0$ being least severe and $1$ being most severe. Corresponding to loss severity $u$ is a ``preference point'' $0\leq\pi\leq1$ such that fear increases as $u$ deviates from $\pi$. For example $\pi=0$ indicates risk aversion behaviour and fear increases monotonically with $u$. On the other hand $\pi=1$ indicates risk seeking behaviour and fear is monotonic decreasing. If $0<\pi<1$ then risk seeking and risk aversion behaviour applies when $u\leq\pi$ and $u>\pi$, respectively. The preference point is exogenously set and is context dependent. For example, conservative reserving requires a low preference point, whereas aggressive pricing sets the preference point at a higher level.

A behavioural change relative to the preference point is consistent with cumulative prospect theory \citep{tversky1992apt} and prospect theory \citep{kahneman1979prospect} where the preference point is relabelled as the ``reference point.'' In particular it is shown that people are risk averse to losses and risk seeking to gains. In the present context of non-negative losses such as in insurance, behavioural change occurs for example when smaller losses below the preference point $\pi$ are of little concern whereas increasing concern is placed on larger losses above $\pi$.

Characterise the above bidirectional fear behaviour by imposing an increasing fear function $\phi\geq 0$ on percentile deviations $\delta_\pi(u)$ of $u$ from $\pi$, yielding the fear adjustment\footnote {Throughout this paper the
notation eg. $(u<\pi)$ indicates the indicator of $u<\pi$.   That is $(u<\pi)$ is 1 or 0 according to whether $u<\pi$ or otherwise.}
\begin{equation}\label{distance}
\phi_\pi\equiv \phi\circ \delta_\pi \cq \delta_\pi(u) \equiv  (u\leq\pi)\frac{\pi-u}{\pi}+(u>\pi)\frac{u-\pi}{1-\pi} \;.
\end{equation}
Positive and negative percentile deviations are each measured on the unit interval, with $\delta_\pi(u)=0$ occurring when $u=\pi$ and $\delta_\pi(u)$ increasing linearly to $1$ when $u$ approaches $0$ or $1$. The fear function $\phi$ translates percentile deviations $\delta_\pi(u)$ into a fear adjustment $\phi_\pi(u)$, minimum at $u=\pi$ and maximum at $u=0$ or $1$. The fear adjustment re-distributes originally uniform loss severities $u$, each corresponding to loss outcome $F^-(u)$. Define the fear adjusted expected loss as the tradeoff premium:
\begin{equation}\label{tradeoff}
\top_\pi\equiv\E\{F^-(u)\phi_\pi(u)\} = \mu +\sigma\sigma_{\phi}\cor\{x,\phi_\pi(u)\}\,
\end{equation}
where $\E$ calculates expectations with respect to $F$,  $\mu$ and $\sigma$ denote the mean
and standard deviation of $x$, while $\cor$ denotes correlation. The second relation follows, as shown below, from assuming $\E\{\phi_\pi(u)\}=\E\{\phi(u)\}=1$, and noting $\phi_\pi(u)$ and $\phi(u)$ have equal standard deviation, denoted $\sigma_\phi$.

The ``tradeoff'' in the tradeoff premium $\top_\pi$ arises from its decomposition
$$
\top_\pi = \var_\pi + (1-\pi)\E\left\{(x-\var_\pi)\phi_\pi(u)|x>\var_\pi \right\}
$$
\begin{equation}\label{decompose}
-\pi\E\left\{(\var_\pi-x)\phi_\pi(u)|x\leq\var_\pi \right\} \;.
\end{equation}
where $\var_\pi\equiv F^-(\pi)$ is the value-at-risk or loss amount corresponding to percentile rank $\pi$ and $F^-$ is the inverse distribution. Risk aversion behaviour above $\pi$ yields an increment $\E\left\{(x-\var_\pi)\phi_\pi(u)|x>\var_\pi \right\}$, or the expected positive deviation with fear adjustment $\phi_\pi(u)$ magnifying larger deviations. Similar risk seeking behaviour below $\pi$ yields a decrement $\E\left\{(\var_\pi-x)\phi_\pi(u)|x\leq\var_\pi \right\}$ based on the expected negative deviation, with fear adjustment. Therefore the overall deviation of $\top_\pi$ from the preference point involves a tradeoff between risk aversion and risk seeking behaviour. The increment and decrement are weighted by $1-\pi$ and $\pi$, respectively, with $(1-\pi)/\pi$ representing the selected tradeoff. Equal tradeoff applies when $\pi=0.5$, with increasing weight on risk aversion when $\pi$ decreases and vice versa.

The left panel in \fref{pricingerrorgraph} displays percentile deviations $\delta_\pi(u)$ as a function of $0\le u\le 1$ for various $\pi$. The right panel displays the fear adjustment $\phi_\pi(u)=\phi\{\delta_\pi(u)\}$ assuming $\phi(u)=5u^4$ and for the same $\pi$'s as used in the left panel. Note $\delta_\pi(u)$ increases linearly from $0$ to $1$ as $u$ departs from $\pi$. In addition $\phi_\pi$ is an increasing transformation of $\delta_\pi$ using $\phi$. The
following subsections consider properties of $\delta_\pi$ and $\phi_\pi$ in further detail.

\subsection{Examples}

The tradeoff premium when $\phi(v)=nv^{n-1}$ is discussed above. Further examples are as follows. If $\phi=1$ then $\phi_\pi=1$  and $\top_
\pi=\mu$. The insurer is neutral to overpricing and underpricing errors.  Further, for any $\phi$, $\top_{1/2}=\mu$ if the loss
distribution is symmetric. If  $\phi(u)=(u=\alpha)$, the  Dirac delta function with $0<\alpha<1$, then $\top_\pi=\pi \var_{(1-\alpha)\pi}+ (1-\pi)\var_{1-(1-
\alpha)(1-\pi)}$. In this case  $\phi$ is not increasing, but  illustrates a two-sided concern for  small and large losses relative to $\var_\pi$, based
on value-at-risk. Section \aref{separation} provides further examples.

\subsection{Standardized tradeoff premium}


The standardized tradeoff premium is
\begin{equation}\label{tradeoff1}
\top^*_\pi\equiv\frac{\top_\pi-\mu}{\sigma} = \sigma_\phi\cor\{x,\phi_\pi(u)\}\ .
\end{equation}
Further $\top_\pi$ is linear: $$
\top_\pi(a+bx) = a+b\times \top_\pi(x)
$$ and  apart from location and scale effects, $\top_\pi$ is determined by two factors:  the ``fear factor" $\sigma_\phi$, independent of $x$ and $\pi$, and the correlation $\cor\{x,\phi_\pi(u)\}$ lying between -1 and 1.  The correlation is the only term in $\top_\pi$ depending on $\pi$.


Equation \eref{tradeoff1} expresses $\top_\pi$ as a standard deviation premium \citep{young2004premium} using the standard deviation
multiple $\sigma_\phi\cor\{x,\phi_\pi(u)\}$. The standard deviation $\sigma_\phi$ measures the overall  aversion to mispricing: large $\sigma_
\phi$ implies paranoia to  mispricing while $\sigma_\phi=0$ implies $\phi=1$ and  neutrality to mispricing. In addition the correlation $\cor\{x,
\phi_\pi(u)\}$ and hence the tradeoff premium decreases with $\pi$, shown and discussed in \sref{negativerelationship}.

\subsection{Percentile deviation}

The conditional random variables $\delta_\pi(u)|u\le \pi$ and $\delta_\pi(u)|u>\pi$ are both uniform on $[0,1]$.
 Thus $\delta_\pi(u)$ is uniform over $[0,1]$.  Overpricing and underpricing  occur if $x<\var_\pi$
and $x>\var_\pi$, respectively, where $\var_\pi\equiv F^-(\pi)$ is the value-at-risk \citep{mcneil2005qrm}  with $F^-$ the inverse distribution
function, assumed to exist.

Note $\delta_0(u)=u$ and $\delta_1(u)=1-u$, $\delta_\pi(\pi)=0$ and $\delta_\pi(0)=1=\delta_\pi(1)$. Pricing error is
zero when the loss outcome  equals  the reference point, and one when the loss outcome is at its minimum or maximum.


\subsection{Aversion function}

The second ingredient in the tradeoff premium is an aversion function $\phi$, describing the aversion to different pricing errors. Assume $\phi
$ is increasing and integrates to one: $\E\{\phi(u)\}=1$ where $u$ is uniform. Unit expectation implies aversion is measured on a relative
scale.  If $\phi(v)\equiv 1$ then there is no magnification or diminution:  all losses are equally disfavoured.


\subsection{Percentile pricing error aversion}

Combining $\phi$ with $\delta_\pi$ yields the percentile pricing error aversion function $\phi_\pi=\phi\circ\delta_\pi$, used to generate weights
when calculating the tradeoff premium. The distribution of $\phi_\pi(u)=\phi\{\delta_\pi(u)\}$ is independent of $\pi$, and identical to that of $
\phi(u)$, noting $\delta_\pi(u)$ and $u$ are uniform. Therefore $\E\{\phi_\pi(u)\}=\E\{\phi(u)\}=1$ indicating an average weight of one in the
tradeoff premium, similar to \citet{furman2008weighted} for one sided weighted premiums. Further if $\sigma_\phi$ is the standard deviation
of $\phi(u)$ then  $\sigma_\phi$ is also the standard deviation of $\phi_\pi(u)$.

Using iterated expectations shows
$$
\E\{\phi_\pi(u)\}=\pi \E\left\{\left.\phi\left(\frac{\pi-u}{\pi}\right)\right|u\le\pi\right\}+(1-\pi)\E\left\{\left.\phi\left(\frac{u-\pi}{1-\pi}\right)\right|u>\pi\right
\} \ .
$$
Both conditional expectations equal one.  Hence the total unit weight in the tradeoff premium is split between overpricing and
underpricing errors according to their respective occurrence probabilities of $\pi$ and $1-\pi$.  (**** This to me appears a problem.    If $\pi$ is near 1 then automatically great weight is given to overpricing and negligible weight to underpricing.   Think about a highly right skewed distribution.)

The same aversion applies to overpricing and underpricing errors based on aversion function $\phi$. Take $\phi(u)=nu^{n-1}$ as an example,
further discussed in \sref{separation}. Then aversion based expectations of overpricing errors $|\var_\pi-x|_+$ and underpricing errors $|x-\var_\pi|
_+$ both focus on the maximum outcome over $n$ independent copies $x_i$  of $x$, leading to  (xxxx this is not clear)
$$
\top_\pi= \pi\left[\var_\pi-\E\left\{\max_{i} \left(x_i|x_i<\var_\pi\right)\right\}\right]$$$$+(1-\pi)\left[\E\left\{\max_{i}\left(x_i|x_i>\var_\pi\right) \right\}-\var_\pi\right]
$$$$
=(2\pi-1)\var_\pi
$$
A similar decomposition of the tradeoff premium, where there is a tradeoff between overpricing and underpricing errors, exists for any $\phi$
and is shown and discussed in \sref{separation}.




\begin{comment}
Note required since already highlighted in the EML example? Note $\phi_\pi(0)=\phi(0)$, (no error) and $\phi_\pi(1)=\phi(1)$ (maximum
overpricing or underpricing error). The equal assessment of over and underpricing implies errors are relative either to over or underpricing
errors. The overall concern of overpricing compared  to underpricing is measured with $\pi$. From \sref{negativerelationship}, increasing $\pi
$ decreases the tradeoff premium.  If $\pi=1/2$  overpricing and underpricing relative to the median is of equal concern.
\end{comment}




\subsection{Two cases of the equilibrium tradeoff premium}

The following are two examples of an equilibrium preference point. The first is a central value balancing overpricing and underpricing errors. The second is a skewed value appropriate for conservative risk measurement such as in reserving. Equilibrium premiums are further discussed in \sref{equilibrium}.

Consider the case where $\top_{\pi}=\var_{\pi}$ or equivalently $F(\top_{\pi})=\pi$. The preference point corresponds to the tradeoff premium, thus percentile deviations are measured between the tradeoff premium and actual loss outcomes. In this case fear relates to mis-pricing. When $u\leq \pi$ or $x\leq \var_\pi$ the tradeoff premium is overpriced leading to diminished competitiveness. On the other hand $u>\pi$ or $x>\var_\pi$ indicates underpricing and a net loss incurred by the insurance company. Setting $\top_{\pi}=\var_{\pi}$ and re-arranging \eref{decompose} yields
$$
(1-\pi)\E\left\{(x-\top_\pi)\phi_\pi(u)|x>\top_\pi \right\}=\pi\E\left\{(\top_\pi-x)\phi_\pi(u)|x\leq\top_\pi \right\}
$$
hence for this instance of equilibrium, expected premium surplus and shortfall, after fear adjustment, are equalised. The fear adjustment overweights larger deviations. Call this equilibrium tradeoff premium the ``balanced premium'', reflecting the balance of overpricing and underpricing errors. For a symmetric loss distribution the balanced premium is equal to the mean or median.

The second equilibrium condition is $\top_\pi=\var_{1-\pi}$. In this case, value-at-risk is used to determine reserves or capital. Of interest is a sufficiently low threshold level $\pi$ indicating the probability of inadequacy or exceedence noting $\p(x>\var_{1-\pi})=\pi$. The preference point $\pi$ yields the tradeoff premium as a expected loss where fear increases as losses increases above the preference point. Dual to any preference point $\pi$ is a ``dis-preference'' point $1-\pi$ such that fear is infinite at $u=1-\pi$ and drops to zero elsewhere. Characterise this fear behaviour using the Dirac-delta function $(u=1-\pi)$, yielding the fear-adjusted expectation $\E\{(u=1-\pi)x\}=\var_{1-\pi}$ or value-at-risk at $1-\pi$. Combining the two dual calculations of fear-adjusted expected loss yields the equilibrium condition $\top_\pi=\var_{1-\pi}$. Substituting this condition into \eref{decompose} yields
$$
\var_{1-\pi}-\var_\pi = (1-\pi)\E\left\{(x-\var_\pi)\phi_\pi(u)|x>\var_\pi \right\}
$$
$$
-\pi\E\left\{(\var_\pi-x)\phi_\pi(u)|x\leq\var_\pi \right\}
$$
hence the distance between the preference and dis-preference points on the actual loss scale is equal to the difference between expected positive and negative deviations from the preference point, allowing for fear adjustment. Assuming a symmetric loss distribution yields xxx.


\begin{comment}
The following illustrates calculations.   Suppose $\phi(u)=5u^4$ and a log--normal loss distribution.

To illustrate the use of the setup to justify a particular $\pi$ assume $\phi(u)=nu^{n-1}$, corresponding to the expected maximum from $n$ independent copies of $x$.    Write $\top_{n\pi}$ as the $\top$ given $n$ and $\pi$.   Then want $n$ such that $\pi=F(\top_{n\pi})$ or $\var_\pi=\top_{n\pi}$

\section{The tradeoff premium and Cumulative Prospect Theory}

Define cumulative weight function $\Phi_\pi$ such that $\Phi_\pi'=\phi_\pi$ with $\Phi_\pi(0)=0$.  Then  $\Phi_\pi(1)=1$ and
\begin{equation}\label{alt}
\top_\pi=\int_0^\infty x\phi_\pi\{F(x)\}\de F(x)
= \int_0^\infty 1-\Phi_\pi\{F(x)\} \de x
\end{equation}
 The final expression follows using  integration by parts and expresses the tradeoff premium as an
expected loss under the modified distribution $\Phi_\pi\circ F$, with density $(\phi_\pi\circ F) \times F'$ where $F'$ is the density corresponding to $F$.  Since $\phi_\pi(u)$
increases as $u$ deviates from $\pi$, the probability of loss outcomes with percentile rank further from the reference point are magnified,

A direct calculation shows
$$
\Phi_\pi(u) \equiv \int_0^u \phi\{\delta_\pi(v)\} \de v = \pi + \frac{(\Phi\circ \delta_\pi)(u)}{\delta_\pi'(u)}
= \pi+\left\{(u>\pi)-\pi\right\}(\Phi\circ \delta_\pi)(u) \;,
$$
where $\Phi=\Phi_0$. The above expressions follow by noting $\delta_\pi$ is piecewise linear. \fref{CPTlinks}
plots $\Phi_\pi(u)$ against $u$ assuming $\phi(u)=nu^{n-1}$, for various $\pi$ and $n$. Note $\Phi_\pi(u)$ is concave for $u\leq \pi$ and
convex for $u>\pi$, corresponding to decreasing and increasing $\phi_\pi(u)$, respectively. In addition $\Phi_\pi(\pi)=\pi$ for any  $\phi$.  The
right panel in \fref{CPTlinks} shows $\Phi_\pi(u)$, in this example, is nearly constant and equal to $\pi$ for a range of $u$ values around $\pi
$. Thus there is a large amount of indifference to, and neglect of, percentile ranks around the reference point. In addition the extent of neglect
increases with $n$, since higher $n$ implies greater weight is placed on ``small" and ``large" percentile ranks.

$\pi=0.5$ and varies $n$.}
    \label{CPTlinks}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The concavity of $\Phi_\pi(u)$ for $u\leq \pi$ and convexity of $u>\pi$ holds generally, and corresponds to the weight function in cumulative
prospect theory (CPT) of  \cite{tversky1992apt}. The weight function transforms cumulative probabilities into decision weights, and is concave
and convex for small and large cumulative probabilities, respectively. The weight function derives its shape from the ``principle of diminishing
sensitivity" where ``the impact of a given change in probability diminishes with its distance from the boundary." Boundaries are $u=0$ and
$u=1$, corresponding to impossibility and certainty in CPT, respectively.






 [Note:  Maybe should look at difference of $\Phi_\pi(u)-\Phi_\pi(v)$ where $u$ and $v$ are ``symmetrically opposed" about $\pi$.   Haven't
looked at details but I think the difference will look simple.]


\subsection{Relation to integral operators}

Interpret $\phi_\pi(u)$ in the second integral in \eref{alt} as an integral operator calculating tradeoff premiums at any reference point $0\leq\pi
\leq 1$ given values-at-risk at all percentile ranks $0\leq u\leq 1$. The inverse integral operator $\psi_\pi(u)$, assuming it exists, reverses the
calculation as
$$
\var_u = \int_0^1 \top_\pi \psi_\pi(u) \de \pi =  \int_0^1 \var_w \int_0^1 \phi_\pi(w) \psi_\pi(u) \de \pi \de w
$$
such  that the inner integral $\int_0^1 \phi_\pi(w) \psi_\pi(u) \de \pi = (w=u)$, or the Dirac delta function.




\begin{comment}

The tradeoff premium equals the expected loss evaluated under a probability distribution modified as in cumulative prospect theory -- CPT
\citep{tversky1992apt}.
Possible outcomes are viewed or ``framed"  relative to a  reference point (often the status quo) rather than to the final status. There are
different risk attitudes towards gains (i.e. outcomes above the reference point) and losses (i.e. outcomes below the reference point) and there
is more aversion to  potential losses than potential gains (loss aversion). Extreme, but unlikely events, are overweighed while ``average"
events are underweighed.



Expanding the final term in the above expression yields [Is this expression really necessary/useful?   Also is the material below just repetitive]
$$
\Phi_\pi(u) \equiv (u\leq \pi) \pi \left\{1- \Phi\left(\frac{\pi-u}{\pi}\right)\right\}
+ (u>\pi)\left\{\pi+(1-\pi)\Phi\left(\frac{u-\pi}{1-\pi}\right) \right\} \;,
$$
such that $\Phi_\pi(0)=0$ and $\Phi_\pi(1)=1$. Thus the tradeoff premium is the expected loss under the modified distribution $\Phi_\pi\circ F
$ with density $(\phi_\pi\circ F)\times f$ where $f\equiv F'$ is the original density. $\Phi_\pi$ transforms original cumulative probabilities into
modified cumulative probabilities, whereas the derivative $\phi_\pi$ weights the density of loss outcomes based on their percentile rank
departure from the reference point.

\section{Varying the reference point and links to distortion risk measures}\label{negativerelationship}

A negative relationship exists between the tradeoff premium and the reference point. In addition the tradeoff premium is bounded by loss
aversion reserves
\citep{choo2009loss}, equivalent to distortion risk measures \citep{wang2000cdo}, where only overpricing or underpricing is considered.

Referring to \fref{CPTlinks}, increasing $\pi$ raises $\Phi_\pi(u)$ for all $u$. This result holds for any $\phi$ (see Appendix
\aref{proofdominance} for proof) and implies a negative relationship between $\top_\pi$ and $\pi$ based on the expression for $\top_\pi$ in the right
hand side of \eref{alt}. The negative relationship is explained by noting a higher reference point increases the proportion of losses associated
with overpricing relative to underpricing, hence decreasing the tradeoff premium.

Since $\top_\pi$ is decreasing in $\pi$,
$$
\E\{x\phi(u)\}=  \top_0 \ge \top_\pi \ge \top_1 = \E\{x\phi(1-u)\} \;.
$$
The lower bound  $\top_1$ focusses on overpricing with monotonic decreasing weights $\phi(1-u)$, while the upper bound $\top_0$ focusses on
underpricing with monotonic increasing weights $\phi(u)$. Thus both $\top_1$ and $\top_0$ are one-sided, whereas $\top_\pi$ for $0<\pi<1$ exhibits a
two-sided consideration of both overpricing and underpricing. Standardized tradeoff premiums corresponding to $\top_1$ and $\top_0$ are,
respectively
$$
\top_1^*= \sigma_\phi\cor\{x,\phi(1-u)\}   \cq \top_0^* = \sigma_\phi\cor\{x,\phi(u)\}\ .
$$
Note $\top_1$ and $\top_0$ fall below and exceed $\mu$, respectively, since $\cor\{x,\phi(1-u)\} \leq 0$ and $\cor\{x,\phi(u)\} \geq 0$. The range of
$\top_\pi$ is largest and equals that of $x$ when the overall aversion level $\sigma_\phi$ is maximum. Examples are shown in \sref{separation}.

The upper bound $\top_0$ is the loss aversion reserve \citep{choo2009loss}. In reserving, aversion increases monotonically with the loss and
``overpricing" is not of concern. The link between $\top_0$ and $\top_1$ and distortion risk measures \citep{wang2000cdo} is established by
substituting $\pi=0$ and $\pi=1$ into the right hand side of \eref{alt}, yielding
$$
\top_0 = \int_0^\infty \{1-(\Phi\circ F)(x)\} \de x \cq \top_1= \int_0^\infty \{1-(\Phi_1\circ F)(x)\} \de x \;.
$$
Therefore $\top_0$ and $\top_1$ are distortion risk measures based on distortion operators $\Phi$ and $\Phi_1$, respectively. In addition $\Phi$ is
convex, whereas $\Phi_1(v)=1-\Phi(1-v)$ is concave and is known as the dual of $\Phi$ \citep{wang2000cdo}.



\subsection{Interpreting the tradeoff premium as an inverse survival function}

For given $\phi$,  since $\top_\pi$  is decreasing in $0\leq\pi\leq 1$, interpret $\top_{\pi}$ as the inverse of a survival function:
\begin{equation}\label{interpretation}
\top_\pi = (1-F_\phi)^-(\pi) \cq F_\phi(\top_\pi)=F_\phi\circ(1-F_\phi)^- = 1-\pi \;,
\end{equation}
where $F_\phi$ is the corresponding distribution function. Note $F_\phi$ is defined from $F$, the distribution function of $x$, and the aversion
function $\phi$. In addition $F_\phi$ has the support $[\top_1,\top_0]$, corresponding to the range of $\top_\pi$. The median under $F_\phi$ is $F_
\phi^-(1/2)=(1-F_\phi)^-(1/2)=\top_{1/2}$, and the mean is
$$
\int_0^1 F_\phi^-(\pi) \de \pi = \int_0^1 \top_\pi \de \pi = \E\left\{ x \int_0^1 \phi_\pi(u) \de \pi \right\}
$$
and is the average value of $\top_\pi$ over all $\pi$, or a weighted average of $x$ where weights are equal to the mixture $\int_0^1 \phi_\pi(u)
\de \pi$ of aversion functions. Section \aref{equilibriumpremium} applies the interpretation \eref{interpretation} when characterizing the
equilibrium premium.



\section{The equilibrium premium}\label{equilibriumpremium}


 The equilibrium  premium equalises expected premium surplus and shortfall overlayed with consistent aversion behavior. The equilibrium
premium measures the central tendency of the loss distribution, akin to the mean and median.

As mentioned in \sref{definition}, a reference point $\pi$ creates disequilibrium if the associated value-at-risk and tradeoff premium are
different: $\top_\pi\neq \var_\pi$. In disequilibrium, assuming $\var_\pi>\top_\pi$, aversion $\phi_\pi(u)$ is decreasing for loss outcomes between $\top_\pi$
and $\var_\pi$, indicating overpricing, even though the tradeoff premium is exceeded implying a premium shortfall. Vice versa when $\var_\pi < \top_
\pi$. The degree of disequilibrium is measured by the difference $\top_\pi-\var_\pi$, and is expressed by multiplying $x-\var_\pi =-|\var_\pi-x|_+ +|x-\var_\pi|
_+ $ by $\phi_\pi(u)$ and taking expectations to yield
\begin{equation}\label{disequilibrium}
\top_\pi-\var_\pi = - \E\left\{|\var_\pi-x|_+\phi_{\pi}(u)\right\} + \E\left\{|x-\var_\pi|_+\phi_{\pi}(u)\right\}   \;.
\end{equation}
Since $\top_0-\var_0>0$ and $\top_1-\var_1<0$, and $\top_\pi-\var_\pi$ is strictly decreasing, there exists a unique $\pi=\pi_*$ attaining equilibrium: $\var_{\pi_*}
=\top_{\pi_*}$. Denote the associated equilibrium premium as $\top_*\equiv \top_{\pi_*}=\var_{\pi_*}$. Equilibrium holds noting losses below $r^*$
simultaneously and consistently represent overpricing (since $x<\var_{\pi_*}$) and a premium surplus (since $x<\top_{\pi_*}$), and vice versa for
loss outcomes above $r^*$.

Substituting $\pi=\pi_*$ and $\top_{\pi_*}=\var_{\pi_*}=\top_*$ into \eref{equalisation} implies
\begin{equation}\label{equalisation}
 \E\left\{|\top_*-x|_+\phi_*(u)\right\}  = \E\left\{|x-\top_*|_+\phi_*(u)\right\} \cq \phi_*\equiv \phi_{\pi_*}
\end{equation}
hence the equilibrium premium equalizes expected premium surplus $|\top_*-x|_+$ and premium shortfall $|x-\top_*|_+$. The aversion adjustment
$\phi_*(u)$ increases in both $|\top_*-x|_+$ and $|x-\top_*|_+$ hence higher premium surplus and shortfall, respectively, are weighted more
heavily. The left hand side of \eref{equalisation}, or the aversion adjusted expected premium surplus, is decomposed as
$$
\E\left\{|\top_*-x|_+\phi_*(u)\right\}
= \E\left\{|\top_*-x|_+\right\} + \cov\left\{|\top_*-x|_+,\phi_*(u)\right\} \;,
$$
and exceeds the original expectation $\E\{|\top_*-x|_+\}$ due to the positive correlation between $|\top_*-x|_+$ and $\phi_*(u)$ for $|r^*-x|_+>0$.  A
similar expansion and interpretation applies to the aversion adjusted expected premium shortfall. Hence aversion adjustment increases both
expected premium surplus and shortfall.

The equilibrium premium is equal to the mean or median $\mu$ for a symmetric loss distribution. The result follows by noting $|\mu-x|_+$ and
$|x-\mu|_+$ are identically distributed and $\phi_{1/2}(u)$ is symmetric about $u=1/2$, corresponding to the median, if the loss distribution is
symmetric. Hence $\top_*=\mu$ satisfies \eref{equalisation}.

A similar result as \eref{equalisation} holds for any reference point $\pi$ and corresponding tradeoff premium $\top_\pi$:
$$
\E\left\{|\top_\pi-x|_+\phi_\pi(u)\right\} = \E\left\{|x-\top_\pi|_+\phi_\pi(u)\right\} \;,
$$
by applying similar calculations as \eref{disequilibrium}. However aversion behaves inconsistently with premium surplus or shortfall
movements in disequilibrium as noted at the start of this section. For example, if $\var_\pi > \top_\pi$, then $\phi_\pi(u)$ is decreasing in the
shortfall $|x-\top_\pi|_+$ for $\top_\pi<x<\var_\pi$. In contrast aversion is increasing in both the premium surplus and shortfall when in equilibrium.



\subsection{Calculating the equilibrium premium}

The equilibrium premium $\top_*$ is the intersection point of $\var_\pi$ and $\top_\pi$ graphed against $\pi$. This calculation is illustration in
\sref{numericaleg}. Alternatively calculate $\top_*=\top_{\pi_*}$ from $\pi_*$ where $\pi_*$ is the fixed point of $F(\top_\pi)$ as a function of $\pi$.
Suppose $F(\top_\pi)$ satisfies conditions underlying Banach's fixed point theorem \citep{banach1922operations}. Then $\top_*$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}\label{iteration}
\top_* = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \top_{\pi_n} , \quad \pi_{n+1} = F \left( \top_{\pi_n} \right)  \;.
\end{equation}
The iterative calculation in \eref{iteration} is interpreted as follows. Given a starting reference point $\pi_0$, the tradeoff premium $\top_{\pi_0}$
is first computed. Disequilibrium arises if the tradeoff premium and the reference point are misaligned: $\var_{\pi_0}\neq \top_{\pi_0}$, and results
in an updated reference point $\pi_1=F(\top_{\pi_0})$ and tradeoff premium $\top_{\pi_1}$. The updated reference point and tradeoff premium are
compared, with further updating conducted if disequilibrium persists. The iteration continues until the sequence $\pi_0, \pi_1, \pi_2,\ldots$
converges to $\pi_*$ and the equilibrium premium is $\top_*=\top_{\pi_*}$. An illustration of the iterative calculations is shown in \sref{numericaleg}.


\subsection{Other interpretations of equilibrium premiums}


The equilibrium premium measures the central tendency of the loss distribution with lower and upper tails magnified by aversion. The mean
loss $\mu$ equalizes expected surplus and shortfall:
$$
\E\left( |\mu-x|_+ \right) = \E\left( |x-\mu|_+ \right) \;,
$$
akin to the equilibrium premium $\top_*$ in \eref{equalisation}, without aversion adjustment. The equilibrium premium differs from the mean loss
depending on the relative impact of aversion adjustment on expected surplus and shortfall. As mentioned above, aversion increases with
deviations $|\top_*-x|_+$ and $|x-\top_*|_+$ leading to ``tail magnification" and an increase in expected surplus and shortfall. For a right skewed
loss distribution, expected shortfall increases by a relatively greater extent, hence the equilibrium premium exceeds the expected loss. Vice
versa. As illustrated in \sref{numericaleg}, increasing right skewness increases the equilibrium premium.

\begin{comment}
Suppose the equilibrium premium is selected to equalize probabilities, instead of expected amounts, of premium surplus and shortfall.
Probabilities are calculated after aversion adjustment with reference point equal to the balanced premium. Then the balanced premium $r^*$
and the corresponding reference point $F(r^*)$ is obtained by solving
$$
(\Phi_{F(r^*)} \circ F )(r^*) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^* = F^-(0.5)
$$
noting the modified distribution function after aversion adjustment at reference point $\pi$ is $\Phi_\pi\circ F$ and $\Phi_\pi(\pi)=\pi$. The
balanced premium is hence the median loss using the hypothetical definition. Note the median loss equalizes surplus and shortfall
probabilities without aversion adjustment. Hence in this case including an aversion adjustment does not alter the central tendency of the loss
distribution.
\end{comment}

An alternative interpretation and hence approximation of $\top_*$ follows from \eref{interpretation} where $\top_\pi$ is treated as the inverse
survival function $(1-F_\phi)^-(\pi)$ applying exceedence probability $\pi$. Then $\top_*$ satisfies $F(\top_*) = 1-F_\phi(\top_*)$ or equivalently $1-
F(\top_*)=F_\phi(\top_*)$ by rewriting the original equilibrium condition $\var_{\pi_*}=\top_{\pi_*}=\top_*$. Therefore $\top_*$ is the midpoint of the distributions
$F$ and $F_\phi$, equalizing the cumulative probability under one distribution and exceedence probability under the other distribution. Hence
approximations of $\top_*$ are
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left\{F^-(1/2)+\top_{1/2}\right\} \cq \frac{1}{2}\left(\mu+\int_0^1 \top_\pi \de \pi\right)
$$
corresponding to the average of medians or means, respectively, noting $\top_{1/2}$ and $\int_0^1 \top_\pi \de \pi$ are respectively the median and
mean under $F_\phi$.



\section{Numerical calculations}\label{numericaleg}

This section calculates tradeoff and equilibrium premiums assuming a gamma loss distribution and power aversion function. Standardized
premiums are considered to eliminate location and scale effects. Both tradeoff and equilibrium premiums increase with the right skewness of
the loss distribution. In addition a higher aversion level increases the tradeoff premium when effects of underpricing concerns dominate
effects of overpricing concerns.

Assume a gamma loss density and power aversion function with parameters $\alpha,\beta>0$ and $n\geq 1$:
$$
f(x) \propto x^{\alpha-1}\exp(-x/\beta) \cq \phi(u)=nu^{n-1} \;,
$$
for $x\geq 0$ and $0\leq u\leq 1$. Increasing the shape parameter $\alpha$ reduces the right skewness of the loss distribution, with $\alpha
\rightarrow\infty$ implying normality. In addition $\beta$ is a scale parameter. The power aversion function is related to the expected-maximal-
loss reserve \citep{choo2009loss}, further discussed in \sref{separation}, where a higher value of $n$ increases the overall aversion to pricing
error.

Assume $\alpha=2$ and $\beta=1$ in the base case. The mean and standard deviation of $x$ are $\mu=\alpha\beta=2$ and $\sigma=
\sqrt{\alpha}\beta=\sqrt{2}$, respectively. Further assume $n=5$, hence the overall aversion is $\sigma_\phi=(n-1)/\sqrt{2n-1}=4/3$.
Parameter values are subsequently varied to assess their impact on tradeoff and equilibrium premiums.

The top left panel in \fref{illustration} graphs standardized tradeoff premiums $\top_\pi^*$ as a function of the reference point $\pi$. As noted in
\sref{negativerelationship}, $\top_\pi^*$ is decreasing in $\pi$ due to an increasing emphasis on overpricing. Effects of underpricing concerns
outweigh effects of overpricing concerns when $\top_\pi^*>0$. Note effects of underpricing concerns are dominant in this case, since $\top_\pi^*$
exceed $0$ for most of $\pi$ in the unit interval. This is due to the presence of extreme large losses in the right skewed gamma distribution.

The standardized equilibrium premium $\top_*^*$ is shown in the same panel as the intersection between $\top_\pi^*$ and standardized value-at-
risk $\var_\pi^*\equiv (\var_\pi-\mu)/\sigma$. Note $\top_*^*>0$, indicating the equilibrium premium exceeds the mean loss. A right skewed loss
distribution leads to an equilibrium premium exceeding the mean loss, discussed in \sref{equilibriumpremium}.

The top right panel in \fref{illustration} displays the original density $f$ and modified density $f_\pi \equiv (\phi_\pi \circ F) \times f$ at $
\pi=0.5$. As shown in \sref{definition}, the tradeoff premium is the expected loss under the modified distribution. Note the modified distribution
in this case is bimodal, with separate peaks below and above the reference point.

The bottom left panel in \fref{illustration} shows the impact on tradeoff and equilibrium premiums when the right skewness of the loss
distribution reduces from increasing $\alpha$. Note aversion based weights $\phi_\pi(u)$ are independent of the loss distribution, and are
higher for extreme loss outcomes further from the reference point. Hence reducing right skewness decreases the tradeoff premium due to a
moderation of large loss outcomes. Similarly for the equilibrium premium.

The bottom right panel in \fref{illustration} shows the impact of increasing the overall aversion to pricing error, based on increasing $n$.
Tradeoff and equilibrium premiums are generally higher when $n$ increases. The reason is increasing $n$ places greater weight on extreme
loss outcomes, and increases premiums for a right skewed distribution where large loss outcomes dominate. However, for a relatively high
reference point, higher aversion reduces the tradeoff premium as large outcomes are underweighted due to the focus on overpricing.

\section{Connections to other literature}\label{otherlinks}

The following connects the tradeoff premium to other existing literature, in addition to those discussed in \sref{definition} (standard deviation
premium and cumulative prospect theory) and \sref{negativerelationship} (loss aversion reserves and distortion risk measures).

The tradeoff premium is a generalised zero utility premium \citep{heilpern2003rank} by applying rank-dependent utility theory
\citep{quiggin1982theory} and assuming a linear utility function. This connection is established by rewriting $\top_\pi$ in \eref{tradeoff} as
$$
\E_\pi\left\{U(\top_\pi-x)\right\}=0\;,
$$
where $U$ is a linear utility function and $\E_\pi$ calculates expectations with respect to the modified distribution $\Phi_\pi\circ F$. However
rank-dependent utility theory assumes $\pi=0$, implying all cumulative probabilities are diminished and underpricing is the only concern. On
the other hand the tradeoff premium magnifies only small cumulative probabilities and diminishes large cumulative probabilities allowing for
overpricing and underpricing concerns respectively.


\citet{kaluszka2011pricing} applies CPT to the generalised zero utility premium, setting the premium as the reference point. Hence overpricing
and underpricing concerns are both taken into account. The equilibrium premium discussed in \sref{equilibriumpremium} is a special case of
the tradeoff premium also set equal to the reference point. However \citet{kaluszka2011pricing} does not allow the reference point to vary to
reflect differential overpricing relative to underpricing concerns between insurers.




\citet{van2001class} use differential probability adjustment to outcomes above and below a fixed reference point, using two separate
distortion operators. The resulting generalized distortion risk measure is applied to asset allocation. However both distortion operators are
convex hence cumulative probabilities are consistently diminished, similar to rank dependent utility. In addition \citet{van2001class}
expresses the reference point in absolute terms, whereas tradeoff premiums specify the reference point as a percentile rank accommodating
all loss scales.





\section{Separating effects of overpricing and underpricing concerns}\label{separation}

The tradeoff premium is decomposed into the value-at-risk at the reference point plus a discount and markup representing overpricing and
underpricing concerns, respectively. The discount and markup are distortion risk measures of corresponding pricing errors where larger errors
receive greater weight. Alternatively the discount and markup are aversion adjusted expected volatilities of pricing errors, and are added to
the expected loss to form the tradeoff premium.

Decompose expectations in \eref{equalisation} into conditional expectations given losses are below and above the reference point, yielding
\begin{equation}\label{twosided}
\top_\pi  = \var_\pi - \pi \top_0(\var_\pi-x|x\leq \var_\pi) + (1-\pi)\top_0(x-\var_\pi|x>\var_\pi)   \;,
\end{equation}
where $\top_\pi(z|A)$ represents the tradeoff premium, at reference point $\pi$, of loss $z$ conditional on event $A$, using aversion function $
\phi$. The expression \eref{twosided} is derived by noting $\delta_\pi(u)$ in $\phi_\pi(u)=\phi\{\delta_\pi(u)\}$ is the percentile rank of $\var_\pi-x$
and $x-\var_\pi$ conditional on $x\leq \var_\pi$  and $x> \var_\pi$, respectively, and $\top_0(x)=\E\{x\phi(u)\}$ for any random loss $x$ with percentile
rank $u$.

Interpret \eref{twosided} as follows. The tradeoff premium is equal to the value-at-risk $\var_\pi$ at reference point $\pi$, plus a discount and
markup equal to the expected overpricing error $\var_\pi-x$ and underpricing error $x-\var_\pi$, respectively. Expected pricing errors are evaluated
using loss aversion reserves and distortion risk measures, discussed in \sref{negativerelationship}, such that higher pricing errors are
weighted more heavily. The presence of the discount and markup indicates a tradeoff: overpricing concerns reduce the tradeoff premium
whereas underpricing concerns increase the tradeoff premium. The net impact indicates the dominant concern. Examples using different
aversion functions $\phi$ are shown in the subsection below.



\subsection{Examples of tradeoff premiums separating mispricing concerns}

The following illustrates \eref{twosided} using various aversion functions $\phi$. The tradeoff premium in \eref{twosided} is formed by applying
a distortion risk measure to overpricing and underpricing errors. Distortion risk measures (equivalently loss aversion reserves) include value-
at-risk, conditional-tail-expectation and expected-maximal-loss, with appropriate selection of $\phi$.

The following applies three selected aversion functions described in \cite{choo2009loss} to the tradeoff premium in \eref{twosided}.
\cite{choo2009loss} constructs other aversion functions based on weighted averages $w\phi_1+(1-w)\phi_2$ and compositions $(\Phi_1\circ
\Phi_2)'$, where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are existing aversion functions and $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ are the corresponding cumulative
aversion functions.

\begin{itemize}

\item Suppose $\phi(v)=(v=\alpha)$ where $0\leq\alpha\leq 1$ is constant. Aversion exists to a single percentile pricing error $\alpha$, and all
other errors are ignored. Then the distortion risk measure is $\top_0(x)=\var_\pi$, the value-at-risk \citep{mcneil2005qrm}. Hence the discount and
markup are, respectively,
    $$
\top_0(\var_\pi-x|x\leq \var_\pi) = \var_\pi-\var_{(1-\alpha)\pi}
$$
$$
\top_0(x-\var_\pi|x>\var_\pi)=\var_{1-(1-\alpha)(1-\pi)}-\var_\pi
$$
or the values-at-risks of overpricing and underpricing errors. The tradeoff premium simplifies to
$$
\top_\pi = \pi \var_{(1-\alpha)\pi}+ (1-\pi)\var_{1-(1-\alpha)(1-\pi)} \;,
$$
or a weighted average of lower and upper loss percentiles. This tradeoff premium is the ``two-sided value-at-risk." Note $\phi$ in this example
is not increasing, but highlights the two-sided feature of tradeoff premiums.


\item Suppose $\phi(v)=(v>\alpha)/(1-\alpha)$ where $0\leq\alpha\leq 1$, hence percentile pricing errors below $\alpha$ are ignored while
larger pricing errors are magnified by the factor $1/(1-\alpha)$. The distortion risk measure is $\top_0(x)=\E(x|x>\var_\pi)$, the conditional-tail-
expectation \citep{mcneil2005qrm}. Similar calculations as the previous example express the tradeoff premium as a weighted average of
expected small and large extreme losses:
$$
\top_\pi = \pi \E\left\{x| x\leq \var_{(1-\alpha)\pi} \right\}
+(1-\pi) \E\left\{x| x>\var_{1-(1-\alpha)(1-\pi)} \right\} \;,
$$
and is called the ``two-sided conditional-tail-expectation."



\item Suppose $\phi(v)=nv^{n-1}$ where $n\geq 1$, thus aversion increases from $0$ to $n$ as pricing errors increase. Then $\top_0(x)=
\E(\max_{i=1,\ldots, n} x_i)$, assuming $n$ is integer, where $x_i$ is an independent realisation of $x$. This distortion risk measure is the
expected-maximal-loss  \citep{choo2009loss}. The tradeoff premium simplifies to
$$
\top_\pi = \pi \E\left(\min_{i=1,\ldots, n} x_i |x_i \leq \var_\pi \right) + (1-\pi)\E\left(\max_{i=1,\ldots, n}x_i|x_i>\var_\pi\right) \;,
$$
or a weighted average of expectation minimum losses and maximum losses below and above the reference point, respectively. This tradeoff
premium is called the ``two-sided expected-maximal-loss."


\end{itemize}
Maximize aversion by assuming $\alpha\rightarrow 1$ in the first two examples and $n\rightarrow \infty$ in the third example. Then the lower
bound $\top_1\rightarrow\min(x)$ and the upper bound $\top_0\rightarrow\max(x)$, hence the tradeoff premium covers the range of loss outcomes.






\subsection{Alternative separation of overpricing and underpricing concerns}


Re-write \eref{twosided} by letting $\sigma_-$ and $\sigma_+$ denote the standard deviation of pricing errors $\var_\pi-x$ and $x-\var_\pi$,
respectively, given $x\leq \var_\pi$  and $x> \var_\pi$. Applying the decomposition $\top_0(z)=\E(z)+\sigma_\phi\sigma_z\cor\{z,\phi(u_z)\}$ from
\eref{tradeoff}, where $\sigma_z$ is the standard deviation of $z$, shows the tradeoff premium as
\begin{equation}\label{loading}
\top_\pi   = \mu+ \sigma_\phi \left\{  - \pi \tilde{\sigma}_- + (1-\pi) \tilde{\sigma}_+    \right\}  \;,
\end{equation}
$$
\tilde{\sigma}_- \equiv \sigma_-\cor\{\var_\pi-x,\phi_\pi(u)|x\leq \var_\pi\}  \cq
\tilde{\sigma}_+ \equiv \sigma_+\cor\{x-\var_\pi,\phi_\pi(u)|x>\var_\pi\} \;,
$$
noting $\mu=\var_\pi+(1-\pi)\E(x-\var_\pi|x>\var_\pi) - \pi \E(\var_\pi-x|x\leq \var_\pi)$. As before $\sigma_\phi$ denotes the standard deviation of $\phi(u)$,
and is also the standard deviation of $\phi_\pi(u)=\phi\{\delta_\pi(u)\}$ given $x>\var_\pi$ and $x\leq \var_\pi$, since $\delta_\pi(u)$ is conditionally
uniform in both cases. Interpret $\tilde{\sigma}_-$ and $\tilde{\sigma}_+$ as the aversion adjusted volatilities of overpricing and underpricing
errors, respectively. Aversion adjusted volatilities are formed by multiplying the corresponding standard deviations with correlations or
``correction factors" lying in the unit interval and measuring the similarity between loss and aversion movements. \cite{choo2009loss} further
discusses correction factors.

The tradeoff premium in \eref{loading} is the expected loss $\mu$ adding a discount $\pi\sigma_\phi\tilde{\sigma}_-$ and markup $(1-\pi)
\sigma_\phi\tilde{\sigma}_+$, representing overpricing and underpricing concerns, respectively. Both discount and markup are proportional to
the overall  aversion to mispricing $\sigma_\phi$ and the volatility of pricing errors. Note the difference with \eref{twosided} where the markup
and discount are relative to the value-at-risk rather than the expected loss. Similar to \eref{twosided}, \eref{loading} emphasizes the presence
of a tradeoff when faced with both overpricing and underpricing concerns.

Based on \eref{loading}, the tradeoff premium exceeds the expected loss, indicating underpricing concern exceeds overpricing concern, if
and only if $(1-\pi)\sigma_+/(\pi\sigma_-) \geq 1$, or the expected loss volatility above the reference point exceeds the expected loss volatility
below the reference point. This occurs given a relatively low $\pi$ or high loss volatility $\sigma_+$ above the reference point.


\begin{comment}
Write $\delta_\pi^+(u)$ and $\delta_\pi^-(u)$ as the two parts making up $\delta_\pi(u)=\delta_\pi^+(u)+\delta_\pi^-(u)$.  Since $\phi(0)=0$, it
follows $\phi_\pi(u)=\phi\{\delta_\pi^+(u)\}+\phi\{\delta_\pi^-(u)\}$ and
$$
\top_\pi-\mu= \cov[x,\phi\{\delta_\pi^+(u)\}]+\cov[x,\phi\{\delta_\pi^-(u)\}]
$$$$
=\pi\cov[x,\phi\{\delta_\pi^+(u)\}|u<\pi]+(1-\pi)\cov[x,\phi\{\delta_\pi^-(u)\}|u>\pi]
$$
[or something like this, forgetting about the covariance of the expectation.  This needs to directly reduce to \eref{loading} below.   Maybe the
above approach is better than the development  in the next paragraph below.]

[Maybe remove this paragraph and instead replace it with the approach above.  I don't think the notation $\var_\pi^+$ and $u_\pi^-$ etc is
needed since it seems covered by $\delta^+_\pi(u)$ etc.]   Define the truncated negative loss deviation from the reference point as $\var_\pi^-
\equiv F^-(\pi)-x$, for $u\leq \pi$. Similarly the truncated positive loss deviation is $\var_\pi^+\equiv x-F^-(\pi)$ for $u>\pi$. The percentile ranks
of $\var_\pi^+$ and $\var_\pi^-$ are respectively:
$$
u_\pi^+ \equiv \frac{u-\pi}{1-\pi}, \quad u_\pi^-\equiv \frac{\pi-u}{\pi}
$$
for $u>\pi$ and $u\leq \pi$. Then, as shown in the appendix, the premium loading is
\begin{equation}\label{loading}
\top_\pi - \mu = - \pi \cov\{\var_\pi^-,\phi(u_\pi^-)\} + (1-\pi) \cov\{\var_\pi^+,\phi(u_\pi^+)\}  \;.
\end{equation}
Both covariance terms in \eref{loading} are positive since $u_\pi^-$ and $u_\pi^+$ are positively related to $\var_\pi^-$ and $\var_\pi^+$
respectively.
\end{comment}










\subsection{Similarity to profit maximizing production firm}


The optimal price obtained by a profit maximizing production firm is similar to the discount-markup structure in \eref{twosided} and
\eref{loading} with the existence of a separate, explicit volume benefit. Suppose the demand $q$ for a product is negatively related to the unit
price $p$. The unit production cost is constant at $c$, and hence the profit margin is $p-c$. Supply is unlimited hence $q$ is the supplied
quantity. In addition assume a volume benefit $\beta$ increasing in $q$, representing economies of scale or, for example, reputation benefits.
The profit is the sum of the volume benefit and the total profit margin:
$$
\omega \equiv \beta+q(p-c) \;.
$$
The optimal price $p^*$ sets the derivative of  $\omega$ with respect to $p$ to zero, thus
$$
p^* = c - \frac{\de \beta}{\de q} + \frac{-q}{\de q/\de p} \;.
$$
Similar to the tradeoff premium in \eref{twosided} and \eref{loading}, the optimal price consists of the production cost $c$ plus a discount $\de
\beta/\de q$ based on the sensitivity of the volume benefit to demand, and a loading $-q /(\de q/\de p)$ inversely proportional to demand
sensitivity to price changes. The production firm faces a tradeoff situation similar to an insurer: increasing the price reduces the volume
benefit, while decreasing the price reduces the profit margin. The two concerns result in a discount and markup applied to the production
cost, respectively.






\section{Practical properties of tradeoff premiums}\label{properties}


The tradeoff premium satisfies practical properties of translation invariance, positive homogeneity and monotonicity. In addition the tradeoff
premium lies within the range of loss outcomes, and is additive for comonotonic losses. The tradeoff premium is not subadditive in general
and is hence not coherent in the sense of \citep{artzner1999cmr}. Both the discount and markup in the tradeoff premium expressed in
\eref{loading} are subadditive, and the tradeoff premium is only subadditive if the markup dominates the discount and vice versa.

In the following denote $\top_\pi(x)$ as the tradeoff premium of a random loss $x$ based on reference point $\pi$, using aversion function $\phi
$. Tradeoff premiums are translation invariant, positively homogenous and monotonic:
\begin{itemize}
\item Translation invariant: $\top_\pi(x+a)=\top_\pi(x)+a$ where $a$ is a constant.

\item Positively homogenous: $\top_\pi(bx) = b\top_\pi(x)$ where $b>0$ is a constant.

\item Monotonic: $\top_\pi(x)\leq \top_\pi(y)$ if $x\leq y$ statewise.
\end{itemize}
The proof follows from the definition of the tradeoff premium in \eref{tradeoff}. Subadditivity requires $\top_\pi(x+y) \leq \top_\pi(x)+\top_\pi(y)$ for any
$\pi$ and random losses $x$ and $y$. Subadditivity does not hold in general. Based on \eref{loading}, the tradeoff premium consists of the
expected loss, and discount and markup proportional to aversion adjusted volatilities of overpricing and underpricing errors. As shown in
Appendix \aref{proofsubadditivity}, aversion adjusted volatilities are subadditive:
\begin{equation}\label{subadditivity}
\tilde{\sigma}_-(x+y) \leq \tilde{\sigma}_-(x) + \tilde{\sigma}_-(y)  , \quad
\tilde{\sigma}_+(x+y) \leq \tilde{\sigma}_+(x) + \tilde{\sigma}_+(y) \;,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\sigma}_-(x)$ and $\tilde{\sigma}_+(x)$ are aversion adjusted volatilities of overpricing and underpricing errors, respectively,
forming the tradeoff premium $\top_\pi(x)$ of $x$. Hence the tradeoff premium is generally not subadditive unless $\pi=0$ implying only the
markup is present. In addition the tradeoff premium is superadditive when $\pi=1$ indicating only discounts are present.

The tradeoff premium also possesses the following other practical properties:


\begin{itemize}


\item Additivity for comonotonic losses. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are comonotonic losses \citep{dhaene2002concept} such that $x$, $y$ and $x
+y$ have equal percentile ranks. Then $\top_\pi(x+y)=\top_\pi(x)+\top_\pi(y)$, since in the case of comonotonicity,
    $$
    \top_\pi(x+y) = \int_0^1 (\var_{x,u}+\var_{y,u}) \phi_\pi(u) \de u = \top_\pi(x)+\top_\pi(y) \;,
    $$
    based on the second expression of $\top_\pi$ in \eref{alt}, where $\var_{x,u}$ and $\var_{y,u}$ are values-at-risk of $x$ and $y$, respectively, at
percentile rank $u$, and noting $\var_{x,u}+\var_{y,u}$ is the corresponding value-at-risk of $x+y$ under comonotonicity.

\item No unfair premium. The tradeoff premium lies with the range of the loss:
$$
\min(x) \leq \top_\pi \leq \max(x) \;,
$$
noting $\top_\pi=\int_0^1 \var_u \phi_\pi(u) \de u$ is a weighted average of values-at-risk of $x$ with positive weights.

\item Preservation of stochastic dominance. Suppose $y$ dominates $x$ in stochastic order, such that $\var_{x,u} \leq \var_{y,u}$ for any $u$.
Then $\top_\pi(x) \leq \top_\pi(y)$, again applying the expression $\top_\pi=\int_0^1 \var_u \phi_\pi(u) \de u$. Therefore larger losses in a probabilistic
sense have larger tradeoff premiums.



\end{itemize}






\section{Applying the tradeoff premium to policyholder perspectives}\label{policyholderperspective}

Similar to insurers, policyholders calculate the tradeoff premium of a loss before purchasing coverage. A different aversion function and
reference point is used. Coverage is bought if the policyholder obtains a smaller tradeoff premium compared to the insurer. Understanding
policyholders' perspectives enables insurers to charge the maximum acceptable premium.

Policyholders form ``two-sided'' weighted averages of losses before purchasing insurance coverage. Large losses relative to a reference
point are over-weighted due to their severe financial consequences. Small losses relative to the reference point are also over-weighted, as
they imply insurance coverage is unnecessary. Hence policyholders calculate a tradeoff premium $\top_{\tau,\psi}$ using reference point $\tau$
and aversion function $\psi$. On the other hand insurers charge the tradeoff premium $\top_{\pi,\phi}$ based on reference point $\pi$ and
aversion function $\phi$.

Consider the case of a single policyholder and insurer. Coverage is bought if the insurer charges a lower tradeoff premium compared to the
policyholder's view: $\top_{\pi,\phi}\leq \top_{\tau,\psi}$. Otherwise $\tau$ or $\pi$ changes, depending on relative bargaining powers of the insurer
and policyholder, until the insurer charges an ``acceptable premium.'' Hence by understanding the policyholder's perspective, an insurer is
able to charge the maximum acceptable premium.

\section{Appendix}


\subsection{Proof that $\Phi_\pi(u)$ is decreasing in $\pi$}\label{proofdominance}
$$
\pi_1 \leq \pi_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (\Phi_{\pi_1} \circ F)(x) \leq (\Phi_{\pi_2} \circ F)(x)
$$
It suffices to prove
$$
\pi_1 \leq \pi_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Phi_{\pi_1}(u) \leq \Phi_{\pi_2}(u) \;.
$$
Firstly there exists a $\pi_1\leq\pi^*\leq\pi_2$ such that $\Phi_{\pi_1}'(u) \leq \Phi_{\pi_2}'(u)$ if and only $u\leq \pi^*$ since
$\E\{\Phi_{\pi_1}'(u)\}= \E\{\Phi_{\pi_2}'(u)\}=1$. Therefore
$$
u\leq \pi^* \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Phi_{\pi_1}(u) \leq \Phi_{\pi_2}(u) \;.
$$
Suppose there exists a constant $a$, where $\pi^*<a\leq 1$, and such that $\Phi_{\pi_1}(a) > \Phi_{\pi_2}(a)$. Then $\Phi_{\pi_1}(u)>
\Phi_{\pi_2}(u)$ for all $u\geq a$ and in particular when $u=1$ then $\Phi_{\pi_1}(1) > \Phi_{\pi_2}(1)=1$, which is a contradiction. Thus $a$
does not exist, implying for all $0\leq u\leq 1$, $\Phi_{\pi_1}(u) \leq \Phi_{\pi_2}(u)$, completing the proof.
